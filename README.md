# Chicago_Treansit_Authority_Ridership_Using_SQL
The program is to analyze a database of Ridership about Chicago’s CTA system. Using the SQL Server database of CTA data, and I have allowed the user to investigate the stations and stops in the system, as well as ridership data. When the application starts, the UI elements are empty.

Step #1: the user selects File >> Load to load the stations in the left- most listbox.

Step #2: the user selects a station from the list, and the UI elements of #2 are populated —ridership data as well as stops.

Step #3: the user selects a stop, and then info about this stop is displayed. The user also has the ability to display the top-10 stations in terms of ridership.

Station name and total ridership; in my design this is invoked through a menu command and displayed.
